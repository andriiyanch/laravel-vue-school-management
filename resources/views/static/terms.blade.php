        <p>(b) As detailed in our Help Centre, your settings, degree of connection with the
        viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our services,
        access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the
        availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your
        profile</p>
        <p>(c) When you post information and communicate about yourself, you are able to
        select the audience for what you share. Such as colleagues, schools, parents.

        people you share this with can see the content you send.</p>
        <p>(d) When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article)
        publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your
        settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your
        publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided
        one)</p>

        where applicable.</p>

        information to third parties.</p>
        <p>(i) People who are able to see your activity are able to share your content outside
        of the audience that you shared it with. For example, if you post an article then
        others will be able to share this on other social platforms.</p>
        <p>(j) Recommendations are under your control and require your approval before
