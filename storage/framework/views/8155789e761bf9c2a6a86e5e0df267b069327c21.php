          <h2>The Home of International Education </h2>
			
<p><h3 class="green">Our Mission</h3></p>
<p>“Just chalk it up to experience” is a phrase we want to exclude from education. Welcome to our one stop shop for schools, parents and educationalists alike. Find the right school for you, discover fair comparisons and be shown services that aren’t trying to scam you out of your lunch money. </p>

<p><h3 class="green">Our Vibe</h3></p>
<p>We love education and all those involved in it. Built by teachers and parents, we aim to be a useful, loyal and rewarding community for those involved in or wanting to be a part of international education.</p>

<p><h3 class="green">Our Promise</h3></p>
<p>To share in your experiences, open opportunities and support you in every step of your journey.</p> 

<p><h3 class="green">Our Story</h3></p>
<p>A teacher and parent played some golf, realised they should stick to what they are good at and came up with the expatsschools. Never again would people get the right advice two years too late. Everything we do is tailored towards education. Along the way they made lots of friends who shared their vision and here we are, together, for you.</p>
